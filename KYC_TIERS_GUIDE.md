# KYC (Know Your Customer) Tiers

KYC (Know Your Customer) tiers are a risk-based approach that financial institutions use to verify customer identity and determine the appropriate level of scrutiny. 

This tiered system aligns with global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CFT) guidelines set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), allowing for simplified due diligence in low-risk scenarios and enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. 

Customers are typically assigned to tiers based on the information they provide, with each tier having specific transaction limits and verification requirements. 

## Common KYC Tiers and Requirements

While specific names and requirements may vary by institution and country (such as the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) three-tiered system), the general structure involves progressive levels of verification: 

### Tier 1 (Basic/Low-Risk Accounts): This is the entry-level tier designed for financial inclusion, allowing customers to open basic accounts with minimal initial documentation.

**Requirements**: Basic personal information such as full name, gender, date of birth, address, and a passport photo. In some regions, a Bank Verification Number (BVN) or National Identification Number (NIN) might be required at this stage.

**Limits**: Accounts at this level typically have restrictions on maximum available balances, single deposit amounts, and cumulative daily transactions.

### Tier 2 (Medium-Risk Accounts): To access higher transaction limits, customers must provide more robust identification.

**Requirements**: Submission and verification of a government-issued identification document, such as an international passport, driver's license, or national ID card.

**Limits**: Limits on balances and transactions are significantly increased compared to Tier 1.

### Tier 3 (High-Risk/High-Value Accounts): This is the highest level of verification, involving extensive due diligence for high-value transactions or politically exposed persons (PEPs).

**Requirements**: A valid ID, proof of address (e.g., a utility bill or bank statement), and potentially biometrics or a "liveliness check" to confirm real-time presence and prevent fraud. Verification of the source of funds or wealth may also be required.

**Limits**: These accounts often have no maximum balance limits and much higher transaction thresholds. 

## Why Tiers are Used

The tiered approach is a practical way for financial institutions to:

- Promote financial inclusion: It makes it easier for unbanked individuals who may lack formal documentation to access basic financial services.
- Manage risk effectively: It applies scrutiny appropriate to the risk level, ensuring high-risk activities receive Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) while low-risk ones benefit from Simplified Due Diligence (SDD).
- Comply with regulations: It helps institutions meet legal requirements for monitoring suspicious transactions and preventing financial crimes. 

If a customer's account activity exceeds the limits of their current tier, their account may be frozen or blocked until they provide the necessary documentation to upgrade their KYC level.
